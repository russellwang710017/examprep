A long date is considered to be something like: "January 1, 2004". A short date is considered to be: "1 Jan 04". The months can be anything from January to December while the days and years are assumed to be correct
(i.e. for example, you do not need to verify that the number of days obeys rules like months have at most 31 days).

The program outputs the converted FILENAME.txt into another file called CONVERTED.txt.
